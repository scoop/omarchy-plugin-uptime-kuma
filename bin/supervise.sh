# Run one helper so that nothing it starts can outlive it.
#
# A helper here is a shell script that builds a pipeline — curl, jq, head, tr.
# Signalling the script reaches the script and nothing else: its curl is a
# separate process with a separate pid, and the shell exiting merely reparents
# it to init, where it keeps the connection open and keeps holding the session
# cookie. Cancelling a poll, or refusing an oversized response, has to reach the
# whole tree or it has not cancelled anything.
#
# So the helper is run as a background job with job control switched on, which
# is what makes bash put it in a process group of its own with the job's pid as
# the group id. Everything it forks inherits that group, and `kill -- -$job`
# then names the whole tree in one call. timeout holds the deadline and turns
# both its own expiry and a signal arriving from outside into TERM to that
# group, SIGKILL after the grace period — and this script confirms afterwards
# that the group is actually gone rather than assuming the signal worked.
#
# Usage: supervise.sh <deadline-seconds> <program> [args...]
#
# A deadline of 0 means no deadline: the polling session is meant to run until
# it is stopped, and is bounded by its caller noticing that it has gone quiet.
# Every other caller passes a number.
#
# The program must be named by absolute path. This is the one door every helper
# comes through, so it is the place to make sure PATH never gets to decide which
# curl, or which login.sh, is the one holding a credential.
#
# stdin, stdout and stderr are the helper's own, so this is transparent to
# callers that feed a credential in on stdin. The exit status is the helper's,
# except when the deadline fires — 124, or a signal status when the group had to
# be killed — and 64 for a usage error here.

# bounded even when the helper ignores TERM. If timeout itself was killed
# outright, nothing escalated and the KILL here is what ends the group.
#
# Signalling by number is only safe while the number cannot have been reused,
# which is why nothing here signals a group it has not just seen alive: a
# process group id stays reserved for as long as the group has a member, and
# until `wait` returns it is also pinned by this shell's own unreaped child.
