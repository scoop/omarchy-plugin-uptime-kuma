// A child process that cannot outgrow a budget, cannot outlast a deadline, and
// cannot leave anything of its own behind.
//
// StdioCollector keeps everything the child writes and only then lets you
// measure it — by the time a length check runs, the bytes are already in the
// shell's heap. This counts each chunk as it arrives, stops at the ceiling, and
// ends the child rather than truncating: an answer that outgrew its budget is a
// refusal, not a value to salvage. The budget covers stdout and stderr
// together, because a helper that says nothing useful very loudly costs the
// shell exactly as much as one that answers at length.
//
// Ending the child is the part that needs help from outside QML. Process.signal
// reaches the process Quickshell started and nothing else, and every helper here
// is a shell script that runs curl, jq and head — so a signal that stops the
// script leaves its curl holding the connection, reparented to init. Every
// command therefore goes through bin/supervise.sh, which puts the helper in a
// process group of its own and turns one signal into a TERM, then a KILL, for
// the whole group, with the exit confirmed rather than assumed. The deadline
// lives there too: a helper that produces no output at all would otherwise sit
// there forever, since a budget on what it says bounds nothing.
//
// The environment matters for the same reason the argv does. Everything this
// spawns is on the path of a password or a session token, and an inherited
// environment carries BASH_ENV, LD_PRELOAD, PYTHONPATH and the proxy variables
// into it — each of which lets another process running as this user decide what
// code runs, or where the credential goes.
